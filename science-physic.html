<p class="range">An average-sized charged cloud weighs as much as 80 elephants</p>
<p class="small">While most clouds we see are made up of tiny liquid water droplets, there is one common type of cloud that’s made of ice: cirrus. These clouds are collections of ice crystals that form in the upper levels of the atmosphere when water vapor deposits onto tiny particles like dust or smoke. Strong winds then shred these clouds apart, giving them their iconic wispy appearance.</p></div>

    <p class="range">VIRGA DOES A DISAPPEARING ACT BEFORE IT REACHES THE GROUND.</p>
    <p class="small">Virga is defined by the National Weather Service as, “streaks or wisps of precipitation falling from a cloud but evaporating before reaching the ground.” ... If the temperature is too far away from the dew point, it means the air could be too dry and will evaporate before reaching the surface.</p></div>
    <div class="col-sm-11 col-md-11 col-lg-4" id="firstrow"> 
<p>DIAMOND DUST ONLY APPEARS IN THE EXTREME COLD.</p><p class="small">Fog is simply a stratum cloud that forms at the surface. Freezing fog is fog that forms when temperatures are below freezing, consisting of supercooled water droplets that have no nuclei to allow them to freeze into ice crystals. Diamond dust, on the other hand, is fog that forms ice crystals instead of water vapor. This rare event occurs when the air is so cold (usually below 0°F) that water vapor condenses into tiny particles in the air, creating ice crystals that float around like snow. Visibility usually doesn't drop much during diamond dust events, resulting in what looks like light snowfall on a clear day.</p>

        <p class="normal"><b>Our sun is a dwarf star</b></p>
        <p class="small">You may have heard of a "white dwarf," but it's not an ordinary star at all, but the corpse of a dead star. Technically, for "ordinary" stars (i.e. astronomical objects that generate their own energy through stable and stable hydrogen fusion), there are only "dwarfs", "giant" and "super-giant". Giants and supergiants represent the late stages of stars, but most stars, which are in a long and mature evolutionary stage, are referred to as "dwarfs". There are quite a few sizes here, but they are all much smaller than giants and supergiants. So, technically, the sun is a dwarf star, also sometimes called a "Yellow Dwarf".</p></div>

        <p class="small"><b>Our sun is also a green (green-blue) star</b>, whose peak wavelength lies clearly in the transition area on the spectrum between blue and green.  This is not just an idle fact, but is important because the temperature of a star is related to the color of its most predominate wavelength of emission. (Whew!) In the sun’s case, the surface temperature is about 5,800 K, or 500 nanometers, a green-blue. However, as indicated above, when the human eye factors in the other colors around it, the sun’s apparent color comes out a white or even a yellowish white.</p></div>

<p class="normal">There are no green stars.</p>
<p class="small">In astronomy, a green star is a blue or white star that appears green because of an optical illusion. There are no true green stars, because the color of a star is determined by blackbody radiation, and this radiation is never green.</p>

<h1>BLACKHOLE</h1>
<p class="white"><b>1. DEFINITION OF BLACKHOLE</b></p>
<img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JP4d5khtQo57pCHGEE8HSd-970-80.jpg" alt="blackholes inside space"/><br>
<p class="white">Black holes are some of the strangest and most fascinating objects in outer space. They're extremely dense, with such strong gravitational attraction that even light cannot escape their grasp if it comes near enough. </p>
<p class="white">So far, astronomers have identified three types of black holes: stellar black holes, supermassive black holes and intermediate black holes.
<i>Stellar black holes</i>
    <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/cygx1_ill_0.jpg" alt="kinds of blackholes-Stellar black holes"/><br>
    Stellar black holes — small but deadly
When a star burns through the last of its fuel, the object may collapse, or fall into itself. For smaller stars (those up to about three times the sun's mass), the new core will become a neutron star or a white dwarf. But when a larger star collapses, it continues to compress and creates a stellar black hole.
<i>Supermassive black holes</i>
<img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AquqrxpMGMq8ok9Xf9HF9k.jpg" alt="kinds of blackholes-Supermassive black holes"/><br>
    Supermassive black holes — the birth of giants
Small black holes populate the universe, but their cousins, supermassive black holes, dominate. These enormous black holes are millions or even billions of times as massive as the sun, but are about the same size in diameter. Such black holes are thought to lie at the center of pretty much every galaxy, including the Milky Way.
<i>Intermediate black holes</i>
<img src="https://www.mobipicker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/blackholes.jpg" alt="kinds of blackholes-Intermediate black hole"/><br>
    Intermediate black holes  — stuck in the middle
Scientists once thought that black holes came in only small and large sizes, but recent research has revealed the possibility that midsize, or intermediate, black holes (IMBHs) could exist. Such bodies could form when stars in a cluster collide in a chain reaction. Several of these IMBHs forming in the same region could then eventually fall together in the center of a galaxy and create a supermassive black hole.
<i>In 2014, astronomers found what appeared to be an intermediate-mass black hole in the arm of a spiral galaxy.</i>
<b>David Shoemaker, spokesman for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) "We have further confirmation of the existence of black holes with stellar masses more than 20 times the mass of the Sun - objects that we do not know. known to exist before LIGO discovered them, said in a statement. LIGO observations also provide insight into the direction of rotation of a black hole. As two black holes spiral around each other, they can spin in the same or opposite directions.
There are two theories about how binary black holes form. The first suggests that two black holes are binary at the same time, from two stars that were born together and die explosively at the same time. The companion stars will have the same direction of rotation with each other, so will the two left-out black holes.

According to the second model, the black holes in a cluster sink to the center of the cluster and pair up. These companions will have random rotations relative to each other. LIGO's observations of companion black holes with different spin directions provide stronger evidence for this formation theory.</b></p>
<p class="white"><b>2. WHERE WILL BLACKHOLES LEAD TO?</b></p>
    <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kATxTFDJyqt3pdUjsU6C7E.jpg" alt="where will they lead to?" /><br>
<p class="white"><i>This will sound like a terrible awful disappointing answer, but there's no other choice.</i>  =(<br>
- So there you are, about to leap into a black hole. What could possibly await should — against all odds — you somehow survive? Where would you end up and what tantalising tales would you be able to regale if you managed to clamber your way back?
The simple answer to all of these questions is, as Professor Richard Massey explains, "Who knows?" As a Royal Society research fellow at the Institute for Computational Cosmology at Durham University, Massey is fully aware that the mysteries of black holes run deep. "Falling through an event horizon is literally passing beyond the veil — once someone falls past it, nobody could ever send a message back," he said. "They'd be ripped to pieces by the enormous gravity, so I doubt anyone falling through would get anywhere."
(By their calculations, quantum mechanics could feasibly turn the event horizon into a giant wall of fire and anything coming into contact would burn in an instant. In that sense, black holes lead nowhere because nothing could ever get inside. This, however, violates Einstein's general theory of relativity.)<br>
